# Movie and TV Show Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of a movie dataset, exploring various aspects of the dataset, including data visualization, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and insights into the distribution of movie-related variables. The analysis uses Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes information about movies, such as titles, types (MOVIE, SHOW, OTHER), descriptions, release years, age certifications, runtime, genres, production countries, seasons, IMDb and TMDb scores, IMDb votes, and TMDb popularity.

## Contents

- Data cleaning and handling missing values.
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to gain insights into the dataset.
- Data visualization, including bar charts, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

## Analysis Highlights

- The dataset primarily consists of movies (64%) and shows (36%).
- Most numeric variables, such as runtime and IMDb score, exhibit a roughly normal distribution, while IMDb votes and TMDb popularity have long-tailed distributions.
- The scatter plot reveals a strong positive correlation between IMDb and TMDb scores (correlation coefficient: 0.89).
- The dataset covers a wide range of movie genres, with comedy, documentary, and drama being the most common.
- The top production countries are the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Japan, and China.
- The number of movies released has steadily increased over time, with a peak in 2018.
